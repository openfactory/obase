/**
 * User: mkuhl
 * Date: 02.05.2010
 *
 * defines the security manager public interface, which is used taglibs and controllers in the plugin and perhaps
 * in the application as well. An instance is supposed to be registered as "securityManager" spring bean via
 * "resource.groovy",etc. Has no inherent Grails dependencies and might well be moved to a separate library sometimes
